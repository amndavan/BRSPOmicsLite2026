## Week 1 :bookmark_tabs:
Students were handed out several bioinformatic articles to be choosen and were asked to make quick summary.\
Through this project students are expected to:
- Gain a concrete understanding of the processes and forms of scientific research through the study of research papers.
- Enhance confidence in reading and comprehending research articles written in English.
- Develop the ability to distill complex material into concise and accessible summaries.
