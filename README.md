# BRSPOmicsLite2026
This will compile all projects done during Bioinformatics Research Starter Program 2026 which is a bioinformatics learning program through hands-on training on bioinformatic data from data-mining, analysis and interpretation.
Repositories would also list all recap on projects done throughout the program.
## Week 1 :bookmark_tabs:
Students were handed out several bioinformatic articles to be choosen and were asked to make quick summary.\
Through this project students are expected to:
- Gain a concrete understanding of the processes and forms of scientific research through the study of research papers.
- Enhance confidence in reading and comprehending research articles written in English.
- Develop the ability to distill complex material into concise and accessible summaries.

Checkpoint on the project handed out on Week 1:
- [x] Quiz
- [x] Learning Module
- [x] Learning Video
- [x] Transcriptomic Article Summary ([here](https://github.com/amndavan/BRSPOmicsLite2026/blob/a329a933c65f44fd4e1a0bcb77ab7ff0a2beff52/Week%201_Paper%20Summary%20Transcriptomics.pdf))

Well done! :trollface:

## Week 2
Students are required to perform Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) analysis using GEO2R by selecting a public transcriptomics dataset based on their preference.\
Through this project students are expected to:
- Become familiar with and confidently use the public database Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
- Be able to evaluate and select transcriptomics datasets that are appropriate for their analytical needs.
- Understand the workflow of differential gene expression (DEG) analysis using the web-based tool GEO2R and be able to interpret the results accurately.
